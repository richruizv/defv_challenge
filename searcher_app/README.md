With this application you can find the adequate recipe using the ingredients you have, just put the ingredients separated with coma in the searcher and the application will find from a vast collection of recipes the most adequate.

You can watch live here ()()


## Technologies

This project was bootstrapped with [React] (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). because I find it interesting to learn a new stack and to show my solid knowledge in javascript language.

## This project was created with a public API

I use [spoonacular-recipe-food-nutrition] (https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition) which  allows you to access over 365,000 recipes and 86,000 food products.

## Installation
Once you download the project with git you should run:

### `npm install`

This will install all the dependencies 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
